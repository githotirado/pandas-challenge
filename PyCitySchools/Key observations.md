Key observable trends based on the data:

District schools vs Charter schools:
1. Only charter schools were in the top 5 school passing performance by overall passing percentages; conversely only district schools were in the bottom 5 for the same passing metric. All district schools were consistently in the 50-60% passing level while all charter schools passed at least 89% of their students.  Reading scores regardless of school type remained consistent, but Math scores were consistently low in district schools compared to charter schools. Work should be put into improving math scores in district schools.

School sizes:
2. There are far more students in the lower performing district schools than the more successful charter schools.  Scores by school size shows that with fewer students per school you get higher average scores and passing percentages.

Per Student Spending:
3. The per student budget in the top 5 and bottom 5 schools were fairly consistent.  In fact, it was slightly higher in the bottom performing schools than in the top 5 charter schools.  The Scores by School Spending shows that there is no improvement in scores by simply budgeting more money per student; there is actually a negative impact on scores as more money is budgeted per student.
